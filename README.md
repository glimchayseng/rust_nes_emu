# NES Emulator in Rust

This is a simple NES emulator built in Rust. I took on this project to both get comfertable with Rust and to deepen my understanding
of lower level architectures and bitwise operations. I have been using this guide to help me accomplish this: [NES Emulator Rust](https://bugzmanov.github.io/nes_ebook/chapter_1.html)

### Current Progress

- CPU architecture completed
- Can run the game Snake
- Most 6502 commands have Unit Tests

### Current Todo
- Flesh out Unit Tests + add more
- Emulate BUS
- Configure ROMs
- Emuate PPU
- Emulate Controller
- Emulate APU
